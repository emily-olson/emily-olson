## Hi there!

My name is Emily, a senior at Brown University studying Applied Mathematics & Computer Science. I'm currently a research assistant in the [Database and Systems Group](https://brown-db.github.io/) at Brown University. Using tools such as Langgraph, vLLM, and DeepEval, I'm building and evaluating an agentic-AI summarization tool for electronic health records. 

I'm particularly passionate about low-level systems programming and cybersecurity. To explore this, I'm currently working on picoCTF challenges and contributing to low-level projects, such as an implementation of blockchain cryptocurrency. I'm excited to learn more about how security and AI can overlap, and aim to pursue this field in my career. 

Reach me at emily_olson@brown.edu!
